## What went Well?
Our first interactions as a group went well, we get along and established a solid line of communication for the semester. We were quick to get all necessary project managegemt tools established and set up. 

## What failed?
We could have done more research on the app block this sprint, to make developing on the next sprint start faster.

## What to do differently?
I could be more ambitious and proactive concerning research on development.
