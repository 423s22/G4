## What went well?
We were able to get progress done very quickly by working together on the last few tasks. We were able to give people what they exceled at so it took less time. 

## What failed?
We still needed to have an increase in communication, because there were a few things that were unclear to members at the begining of the sprint. 

## What to do differently?
Make sure that our sprint plans are looked at by the whole team and disscussed a little more.

## What went well?
Interopability with Shopify went smoothly, and brought us to a finished state of our app. The work between teammates was easily merged and came together quite seamlessly.

## What failed?
The theme app extension had not been developed on time as desired, and so I had to go and finish it in order to have a completed project, rather than wait for the teammate responsible to complete it.

## What to do differently?
Make expectations clearer and increase the frequence of checking in so we can more quickly adapt to various situations.
