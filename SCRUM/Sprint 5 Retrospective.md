## What went well?
We were able to get progress done very quickly by working together on the last few tasks. We were able to give people what they exceled at so it took less time. 

## What failed?
We still needed to have an increase in communication, because there were a few things that were unclear to members at the begining of the sprint. 

## What to do differently?
Make sure that our sprint plans are looked at by the whole team and disscussed a little more.
