## What went well?
We had set ourselves up to be able to focus on the fine details this sprint which was very helpful. 

## What failed?
Because there wasn't class there was a lot less communication this sprint. I had all classes and assignments end on Friday of last week so I wasnt really focused on this so much as getting ready for company and graduation. 

## What to do differently?
Probably meet outside of class if only virtually at least. That would have at least helped with the communication on what to do this sprint.
