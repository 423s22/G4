## What went well?
We had set ourselves up to be able to focus on the fine details this sprint which was very helpful. 

## What failed?
Because there wasn't class there was a lot less communication this sprint. I had all classes and assignments end on Friday of last week so I wasnt really focused on this so much as getting ready for company and graduation. 

## What to do differently?
Probably meet outside of class if only virtually at least. That would have at least helped with the communication on what to do this sprint. 

# Jacob Hofer
## What went well?
Getting our code and documentation cleaned up was easy, since we had individual parts we had each worked on that we knew extensively how they worked in order to properly comment.

## What failed?
Not all members followed the proper guidelines for committing, either accidentally pushing directly into main (my fault, whoops) or not allowing time for other members to submit their reviews before merging a PR.

## What to do differently?
Reinforce expectations for managing and using GitHub
