## What went well?
We were able to get a lot done because we had been able to give tools to others.

## What failed?
We still had one team member behind so it became very difficult for them to be able to meet expectations. 

## What to do differently?
Make sure we are ALL up to speed and feeling like we understand what is going on in current development.

## What went well?
A lot of work on the admin-side was achieved, both on the front-end and back-end. 

## What failed?
The theme app extension is still lacking any substantial code to interface with the built out APIs.

## What to do differently?
Better ensure everyone is aware of the tasks at hand, and feel comfortable with asking for help.
