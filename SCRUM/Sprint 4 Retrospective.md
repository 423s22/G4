## What went well?
We were able to get a lot done because we had been able to give tools to others.

## What failed?
We still had one team member behind so it became very difficult for them to be able to meet expectations. 

## What to do differently?
Make sure we are ALL up to speed and feeling like we understand what is going on in current development.
