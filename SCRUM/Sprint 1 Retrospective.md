# Faith Nelson
## What went well?
We communicated that we were having difficulties, and we helped each other through. The review process also allowed us to make sure we were all on the same page and not get too confused for the entire project.

## What failed?
I was a little confused about what we were wanting to do and that made it difficult to get started and to create content that was acceptable. 

## What to do differently?
Define a little more of how we want to design things together as a group before separating off to do the designing. Because if we are each designing things differently they may not all mesh together.

# Jacob Hofer
## What went well?
Dividing up different parts of the project equally so everyone had a different part of the project to work on that suited their strengths.

## What failed?
Accidental miscommunication about what the "developer architecture" actually meant. This caused Faith and I to work on the same diagram. In the end this worked out well though, as we both gained a better understanding of how best to design our app.

## What to do differently?
Increase cohesion between different tasks. The tasks were a bit too discrete, and this caused integration issues when bringing all of them together.
