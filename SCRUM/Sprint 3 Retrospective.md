## What went Well?
Our group work was the best it had been thus far, communication continues to improve each sprint. All group members were able to set up our environment on our PC's with collaboration.

## What failed? 
I was still confused on project structure. In trying to do my work, I did not have a sufficient enough understanding of what we had vs what we needed to complete my work to the degree I desired.

## What to do differently?
Scedule more meetings with group members out of class to clarify confusions in development to prevent barriers in coding.
