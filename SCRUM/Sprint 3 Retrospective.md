## What went well?
We really seemed to get into a groove of being able to ask for help from Jacob. I felt like we really were able to get on the same page about what each of us are doing. 

## What failed?
I feel like there may have been some lack of communication between some of us in explaining the changes that are being made once we figured out how to move forward. 

## What to do differently?
Maybe give more group demos and code reviews.

## What went Well?
Our group work was the best it had been thus far, communication continues to improve each sprint. All group members were able to set up our environment on our PC's with collaboration.

## What failed? 
I was still confused on project structure. In trying to do my work, I did not have a sufficient enough understanding of what we had vs what we needed to complete my work to the degree I desired.

## What to do differently?
Scedule more meetings with group members out of class to clarify confusions in development to prevent barriers in coding.
