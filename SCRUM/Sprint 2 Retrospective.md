# Faith Nelson
## What went well?
We communicated that we were having difficulties, and we helped each other through. We also meet throughout the week allowing for a little bit of a longer block of time giving more access to communication and work. 

## What failed?
I felt like I was not helping, and that I maybe didn't have the tools to complete the task given, in the time I had. 

## What to do differently?
Gather tools ahead and be able to have some help prior to the end of the sprint. 

# Jacob Hofer
## What went well?
Dividing up different parts of the project equally so everyone had a different part of the project to work on that suited their strengths.

## What failed?
Accidental miscommunication about what the "developer architecture" actually meant. This caused Faith and I to work on the same diagram. In the end this worked out well though, as we both gained a better understanding of how best to design our app.

## What to do differently?
Increase cohesion between different tasks. The tasks were a bit too discrete, and this caused integration issues when bringing all of them together.

# Megan Fehres
## What went Well?
We found a candidate solution to one of our post major questions and client demands, and the structure of the app is begginig to have a solid formation. We all have a solid picture of the structure of the application after considering its basic architecture.

## What failed?
Many blockers this week, not-ideal comunication of how each of our tasks works together and how we can all come together to find a solution.

## What to do differently?
Involing group members in all components of the project, be it planning, back end development, and front end design and development.
