## What went well?
We communicated that we were having difficulties, and we helped each other through. We also meet throughout the week allowing for a little bit of a longer block of time giving more access to communication and work. 

## What failed?
I felt like I was not helping, and that I maybe didn't have the tools to complete the task given, in the time I had. 

## What to do differently?
Gather tools ahead and be able to have some help prior to the end of the sprint.

## What went well?
Getting the actual development loop started and creating functionality. Each core part of our software is there, so now we are able to focus on writing all of the actual logic.

## What failed?
As a whole documentation about Shopify, React, etc. is lacking a decent amount. This meant we had a lot of trial and error on our part, which ate up a ton of time. Small nuances in things like GET/POST requests, or the order of events in React added extra difficulty.

## What to do differently?
Focus much more on research and sharing information between all three of us. Setting up better workflows for personal development will also help immensely, instead of all three of us attempting to develop on the same server and the same store.

## What went Well?
We got a large part of the Architecture of our app done, and our database is solid. We communicated more than previous sprint, and asked other memebers for help when needed. Each member knew what the other was working on, how it was going, and what difficulties they may have. 

## What failed?
It was a very busy 2 weeks in my personal life which made me push things father off than I anticipated. I struggled with the command line portion of the app development, making it hard to truly contribute the work i knew I could do. There were minimal resources on how to fix the issues i was having online and I spent most of my time fiddling wth the command line. 

## What to do differently?
Detect personal software issues early on, find ways to contrubute work more even if I cannot work around them.
