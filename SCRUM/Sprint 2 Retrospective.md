# Faith Nelson
## What went well?
We communicated that we were having difficulties, and we helped each other through. We also meet throughout the week allowing for a little bit of a longer block of time giving more access to communication and work. 

## What failed?
I felt like I was not helping, and that I maybe didn't have the tools to complete the task given, in the time I had. 

## What to do differently?
Gather tools ahead and be able to have some help prior to the end of the sprint. 

# Jacob Hofer
## What went well?
Dividing up different parts of the project equally so everyone had a different part of the project to work on that suited their strengths.

## What failed?
Accidental miscommunication about what the "developer architecture" actually meant. This caused Faith and I to work on the same diagram. In the end this worked out well though, as we both gained a better understanding of how best to design our app.

## What to do differently?
Increase cohesion between different tasks. The tasks were a bit too discrete, and this caused integration issues when bringing all of them together.

# Megan Fehres
## What went Well?
We got a large part of the Architecture of our app done, and our database is solid. We communicated more than previous sprint, and asked other memebers for help when needed. Each member knew what the other was working on, how it was going, and what difficulties they may have. 

## What failed?
It was a very busy 2 weeks in my personal life which made me push things father off than I anticipated. I struggled with the command line portion of the app development, making it hard to truly contribute the work i knew I could do. There were minimal resources on how to fix the issues i was having online and I spent most of my time fiddling wth the command line. 

## What to do differently?
Detect personal software issues early on, find ways to contrubute work more even if I cannot work around them.
